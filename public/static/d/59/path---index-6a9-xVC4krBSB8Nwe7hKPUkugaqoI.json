Yes, we can use standard   or any other   that is available to us, but what we really want to have is some way to have a log available, when it’s allowed and to hide the logging, when we’re not interested in it. So let’s review this. Here are the required features: Should be based on a standard   object. Should show 3 methods:  ,  ,   - behind the scenes they should use methods from the standard   object.

It’s always fun to complain where there is no PM in the workplace, but I wanted to see what was really missing, and why a PM was needed. So I decided to learn this top`ic by myself, I had some free time to spare, so why not? Let’s start with Coursera. It has university-based content.
