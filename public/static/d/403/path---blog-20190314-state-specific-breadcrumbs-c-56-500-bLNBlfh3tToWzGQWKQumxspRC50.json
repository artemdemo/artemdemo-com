It will be a simple one, as we don’t need to make it complicated. I’m building an application that is dealing with some kinds of deliveries. There are “parcels”, that have packages and items. They are dependent on each other and they can be presented in the following way:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Parcels</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Parcels: delivered</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Single parcel</li>\n<li>Package</li>\n<li>\n<p>List of items</p>\n<ul>\n<li>List of items: red</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Single item</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/100a7e8aa208028ca0a43f16e73ec99d/87196/breadcrumbs-sequence.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 590px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAPCAYAAADkmO9VAAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAAA/0lEQVQ4y+1RO2rDQBTct658AWNCuuAysu/gLlWOkSrkFkYCQ+4mCf3/X4SkRo0aQeYp/uDW6YIHxHs7qzc7syvKshSMuq4pDMOF67oyyzICL23bXnDt+57SNJWe58mmaWTbtsQ9c+M4zvPDMIgL8jwn8QdM03RdBEEguUZRtLcs62gYhub7/jv4D13Xv1E/ceAbnKumaapxHH/B2R69Bu7Qdd0zz1dV9WsKMcVJcIUYW8dxFIg8Yf2CyDvUDQTW4BQIKBDcJEmy4h7cK4SWPF8UxdXlWfRe4I5vIl9E4ZBwMiEy8wS3/FAEVwLcvAfH/InTf4QHnOeRQjzwwL/FD8ANxX7XjNOqAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Breadcrumbs sequence\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/100a7e8aa208028ca0a43f16e73ec99d/623ee/breadcrumbs-sequence.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/100a7e8aa208028ca0a43f16e73ec99d/816c5/breadcrumbs-sequence.png 148w,\n/static/100a7e8aa208028ca0a43f16e73ec99d/c766b/breadcrumbs-sequence.png 295w,\n/static/100a7e8aa208028ca0a43f16e73ec99d/623ee/breadcrumbs-sequence.png 590w,\n/static/100a7e8aa208028ca0a43f16e73ec99d/e5345/breadcrumbs-sequence.png 885w,\n/static/100a7e8aa208028ca0a43f16e73ec99d/87196/breadcrumbs-sequence.png 1024w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p>As you can see from the list, the parcels and items can be sorted. Packages are presented in a simple list and you just need to find the right one.</p>\n<p>Now, we need to define functionality for our breadcrumbs that will define whether we implement them or not. So the requirements are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Breadcrumbs list should be activated when the user enters a page that allows breadcrumbs.</li>\n<li>If the user enters a page with no breadcrumbs, then the breadcrumbs data should be lost.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Each crumb should also display filters that have been applied on the list that the user saw on the previous page.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The user should be able to click on the breadcrumb and go back to the page with the same filtered (or sorted) list.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The user should be able to send a link to the current page, with breadcrumbs, to a coworker and he will see exactly the same breadcrumbs history.</li>\n</ol>","frontmatter":{"title":"State-specific breadcrumbs","date":"March 14, 2019","tags":["breadcrumbs","browser history"]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/20190314-state-specific-breadcrumbs/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/20190308-catch-and-log-errors-in-NodeJS-app/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Catch and log errors in NodeJS app","tags":["node.js","error handling"]}},"next":null}}
