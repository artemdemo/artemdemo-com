Really, there were 17 sections, each one included from 3 to 26 videos. Each video was from 3, up to 16 minutes. This all added up to a very long course. On the other hand, what did you expect? To learn the profession in one sitting? Sadly it’s not the case. Of course, even after that course, you wouldn’t, by any means, be a good product manager. What you would lack would be real-world experience, but at least you would have a good start if you were dedicated and…","fields":{"slug":"/20190316-udemy-become-a-product-manager/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"16 March, 2019","title":"Become a Product Manager [udemy]"}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"\nBreadcrumbs can be displayed in different ways. Usually, this is solved in a naive way - if a user enters the page where a certain product is displayed, then he will see breadcrumbs from categories that are hierarchically dependent on each other. This is reasonably easy to implement because it is static information. The more complex requirement is to display a history of the changes, where we'll see not only the previous pages but also the filters that have been applied to them.\n\n","fields":{"slug":"/20190314-state-specific-breadcrumbs/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"14 March, 2019","title":"State-specific breadcrumbs"}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"\nErrors will occur no matter what, but I hope that’s not stopping you from writing code because it doesn't matter if you stop - someone else will continue the tradition instead :) So the only proper solution is to be prepared and to handle errors in the right way.\n\n","fields":{"slug":"/20190308-catch-and-log-errors-in-NodeJS-app/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"08 March, 2019","title":"Catch and log errors in NodeJS app"}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"\nLet's talk for a moment about logging in the FrontEnd application. Yes, we can use standard `console.log` or any other `console[method]` that is available to us, but what we really want to have is some way to have a log available, when it's allowed and to hide the logging, when we're not interested in it.

It’s always fun to complain where there is no PM in the workplace, but I wanted to see what was really missing, and why a PM was needed. So I decided to learn this top`ic by myself, I had some free time to spare, so why not? Let’s start with Coursera. It has university-based content.
