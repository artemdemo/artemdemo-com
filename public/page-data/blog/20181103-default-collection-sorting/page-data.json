For example, it may return only the first 1000 entries.\nIn this case we can’t sort data on the client,\nbecause sorting should be part of the query and should be taken into account in the server.</p>\n<p>The next situation is when the server indeed returns all data to the client.\nUsually this happens when a project is in the early stage of development and server sorting\nhasn’t been implemented yet or a collection is small by design and shouldn’t grow.\nIn this case, sorting can be done in the client.</p>\n<p>But even when sorting is done in the client,\nit doesn’t mean that the default order of the items should be defined by the client.\nYou see, the server will need to fetch data from the database anyway, it’s not like it has any other choice.\nSo if data has already been fetched by some query, why not define sorting in the same query?\nThe client will take it from here, but the default order should be a server side problem.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Where the default sorting of a collection should be done","date":"November 03, 2018","tags":["sorting","collections","order"]}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/20181103-default-collection-sorting/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/20181104-replacing-momentjs/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Replacing moment.js with date-fns","tags":["moment.js","date-fns"]}}}}}
