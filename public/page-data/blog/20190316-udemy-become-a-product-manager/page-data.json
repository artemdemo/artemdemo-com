Really, there were 17 sections, each one included from 3 to 26 videos. Each video was from 3, up to 16 minutes. This all added up to a very long course. On the other hand, what did you expect? To learn the profession in one sitting? Sadly it’s not the case.</p>\n<p>Of course, even after that course, you wouldn’t, by any means, be a good product manager. What you would lack would be real-world experience, but at least you would have a good start if you were dedicated and willing to learn.</p>\n<p>The course was based on practical examples and a lot of methods for product analysis. I started it because it was important for me to understand what were the challenges of product managers. Currently, I’m not planning to change jobs, but I always aim to better understand the professional landscape and such courses look like a good opportunity to do so.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Become a Product Manager [udemy]","date":"March 16, 2019","tags":["udemy","product management","studying"]}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/20190316-udemy-become-a-product-manager/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/20190314-state-specific-breadcrumbs/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"State-specific breadcrumbs","tags":["breadcrumbs","browser history","routing"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/20190503-mock-wiht-jest/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How to mock components with jest","tags":["jest","test","mocks"]}}}}}
