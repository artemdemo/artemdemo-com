Really, there were 17 sections, each one included from 3 to 26 videos. Each video was from 3, up to 16 minutes. This all added up to a very long course. On the other hand, what did you expect? To learn the profession in one sitting? Sadly it&#x27;s not the case.</p><p>Of course, even after that course, you wouldn&#x27;t, by any means, be a good product manager. What you would lack would be real-world experience, but at least you would have a good start if you were dedicated and willing to learn.</p><p>The course was based on practical examples and a lot of methods for product analysis. I started it because it was important for me to understand what were the challenges of product managers. Currently, I&#x27;m not planning to change jobs, but I always aim to better understand the professional landscape and such courses look like a good opportunity to do so.</p></div></div></div></body></html>
