Usually, this is solved in a naive way - if a user enters the page where a certain product is displayed, then he will see breadcrumbs from categories that are hierarchically dependent on each other. This is reasonably easy to implement because it is static information. The more complex requirement is to display a history of the changes, where we&#x27;ll see not only the previous pages but also the filters that have been applied to them.</p><p></p></div></div></div><div><h3><a href="/blog/20190308-catch-and-log-errors-in-express-app/">Catch and log errors in Express app</a></h3><div class="secondary-text">08 March, 2019</div><div class="post-preview-content"><div></div><div class="post-preview-content__excerpt"><p></p><p>Errors will occur no matter what, but I hope thatâ€™s not stopping you from writing code because it doesn&#x27;t matter if you stop - someone else will continue the tradition instead :) So the only proper solution is to be prepared and to handle errors in the right way.</p><p></p></div></div></div><div><h3><a href="/blog/20190303-custom-logger-for-the-frontend-application/">Custom logger for the Frontend application</a></h3><div class="secondary-text">03 March, 2019</div><div class="post-preview-content"><div></div><div class="post-preview-content__excerpt"><p></p><p>Let&#x27;s talk for a moment about logging in the FrontEnd application.
