But that&#x27;s okay, we&#x27;ll go through all of them and we&#x27;ll find the best one for each project. Or at least this is something that we should do as responsible developers.</p><p>I heard about this library during the front-end conference that I attended a year ago. The funny part is that it was the first time I heard about this library. Strange, since I always try to stay in the loop and check new solutions that pop up in the market, but Svelte somehow flew under my radar.</p><p>I must say, this first talk about <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a> was very interesting. Rich Harris (author of the library) found a unique feature proposition that most modern frameworks lack. You know, honestly, most of them are doing the same thing, just naming it differently, which is not the case with Svelte.</p><p>The unique proposition of Svelte is that it&#x27;s tiny and crazy fast. The performance is so much better than any other framework out there, that it&#x27;s almost painful to compare Svelte to any other library. This is the benchmark comparison for some libraries:</p><p><img src="svelte-benchmarks.jpeg" alt="Svelte benchmarks"></p><p>You see that it&#x27;s 35 times faster than React! Ok, now let&#x27;s take a deep breath and see what&#x27;s going on here.</p><p>First, even if it&#x27;s that fast it usually doesn&#x27;t matter. Because in most cases we&#x27;re dealing with simple cases of UI, like display forms, simple UX interactions, little animation here and there and this is it. This performance boost wouldn&#x27;t be visible in any modern browser.</p><p>Another thing is the size. As you can see, there is no library size for Svelte and the reason is that it came with a built-in compiler that will take only what is needed for each component. Which is great, since we don&#x27;t want to bring with us overhead of unused methods when the developer asked for only specific ones.</p><p>But the devil is in the details, I said that compiler will take necessary functions for each component. It means that theoretically, you can create so many components that additional code will exceed standard library size. It&#x27;s a good point, but irrelevant, for two reasons:</p><ol><li>You need to create a lot of components (something like more than 500 of them).</li><li>You always can split the code and load what is necessary for the given view (by the way, you always should do it).</li></ol><p>Now, let&#x27;s talk about the use cases. Obviously, the community of the popular frameworks (like React or Angular) is much larger and if you choose to use &quot;big guns&quot; you&#x27;ll get a lot of perks along the way - tested solutions for various problems, open-source components, etc. Svelte is young and its community is not filled with lots of ready to go solutions, therefore it can&#x27;t compete in this field and it doesn&#x27;t need to.</p><p>You should decide to choose Svelte, when performance and size really matter.</p><p>For example, when you&#x27;re developing an application for low power devices. For instance in Brazil they have portable POS systems, that looks like this:</p><p><img src="svelte-pos-device.png" alt="Svelte POS device"></p><p>In this case, you simply can&#x27;t use a mainstream framework. It will work, but the user experience will suffer. You&#x27;ll need either to write the whole system in vanilla js and hope that you&#x27;ll be able to pull it or to use a really lightweight framework optimized for low memory footprint like Svelte. And the results are very good:</p><p><img src="svelte-pos-twitter.jpg" alt="Svelte POS twitter"></p><p>So, that is my two cents about svelte and why you should take a look at it. It is always nice to be aware of different solutions in the market, so you could take one of them from the shelves in time of need.</p></div></div></div></body></html>
