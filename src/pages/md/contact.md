# Contact me

Hi there!

If you want to drop me a line, you're more than welcome to do so.
As you can see, I'm using a form instead of a simple email address.
There are some reasons for that:

* I don't want to get more spam than I'm already receiving.
* By using a dedicated form I will have saved copy of the email, in case I remove one from my inbox by accident.
* And finally I think it's simply faster for the user. You don't need to click on the email, wait until your client opens and then do exactly what you can do on this very page :)
