Hi guys,

My name is Artem and I'm a Frontend developer.
I live and work in Tel Aviv, while trying to build useful things. I decided to start this blog for number of reasons:

First, I really believe in knowledge sharing.
This is what continues to improve the web industry and each developer can only benefit from that
(the one who shares and the one who can find useful information on the internet).

Second, writing helps me better understand the concepts.
You truly start to understand something, only when you start to explain it to someone.
I know that for some it could seem unintuitive, but it's true.
By explaining complicated concepts we start to understand them better ourselves.

If you're interested in my open source projects, or code examples, you can checkout

Best, <br />
Artem
