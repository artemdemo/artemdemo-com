Today is an important milestone - I create favicon for my website (the one you're viewing right now) ðŸŽ‰

![Favicon for my gatsby website](favicon.png)

First of all I'm using [gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) a react-based framework to build this website.
And of course, in order to add any feature it's better to check the documentation first, other than invent your own approach.

It turns out that it's fairly easy to add favicon.
You just need to place it in the `/static` folder instead of default one, which is just empty square by the way.
