They do have their lifecycle.\nThey can’t check for collisions at any given moment.\nTherefore, if you have a gameObject that moves fast enough,\nit can pass the collider check “between heartbeats” and wouldn’t trigger the collision function.</p>\n<p>The solution is to write a custom collision check.\nNow your situation may be different, but the general approach is the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>When object starts to move check whether it has intractable layers in its path.</li>\n<li>On each update (it’s better to use FixedUpdate for performance) check again, in case your aim is moving.</li>\n<li>If you detect something on the path - store the hit point.</li>\n<li>On each update (again FixedUpdate) check whether you passed stored hit point or not yet.</li>\n<li>If you passed it - you can process collision.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>With this approach it doesn’t matter what is the speed of your “bullet”.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Object moves too fast for the collider to catch (solution for unity)","date":"January 18, 2021","tags":["game","unity"]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/20210118-unity-object-moves-too-fast-for-the-collider-to-catch/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/20210103-game-experiment/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"I started new game experiment","tags":["game","pixel art","unity"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/20210128-vertical-lines-between-tiles/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Vertical lines between tiles in tile map in unity","tags":["unity","tiles"]}}}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
