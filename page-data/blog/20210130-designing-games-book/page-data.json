It’s not in sculpting game pieces or painting game boards. Game design means crafting the rules that make those pieces come alive.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>If you want a metaphor to use while thinking about games, don’t think of stories or movies. … Instead, think of a game as a strange kind of machine—an engine of experience.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And one of the best statements and paradoxes for the perfectionists out there:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>In game design, temporarily accepting poor-quality work ultimately leads to better-quality work. This is the PARADOX OF QUALITY.</em></p>\n</blockquote>","frontmatter":{"title":"Designing Games, book by Tynan Sylvester","date":"January 30, 2021","tags":["book","studying","game"]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/20210130-designing-games-book/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/20210128-vertical-lines-between-tiles/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Vertical lines between tiles in tile map in unity","tags":["unity","tiles"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/20210201-2d-platformer-explosion-wave-in-unity/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"2D explosion wave in unity","tags":["unity","game"]}}}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
